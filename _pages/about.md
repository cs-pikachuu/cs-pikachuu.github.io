This is Haotian Hu <span style="font-family: 'Kaiti SC', 'STKaiti', 'KaiTi', cursive;font-size: 1.3em">「胡皓天」</span>. I'm currently an incoming [Machine Learning Ph.D](https://ml.gatech.edu/phd). student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Georgia Institute of Technology, working with Prof.[Faramarz Fekri](https://fekri.ece.gatech.edu/). Previously, I recieved my bachelor degree from University of Science and Technology of China, [School of the Gifted Young](https://sgy.ustc.edu.cn/mainm.htm). 

My current research focuses on building efficient and reliable machine learning systems, specifically in the following topics: 
(i) Hypothesis generation with Large Language Models; 
(ii) Large Language Models Towards Reasoning; 
(iii) Deep Learning Theory;

I was fortunate to cooperate with [Zhenyu Zhang](https://zhenyu.gallery/)@UT-Austin (Atlas Wang - [VITA](https://vita-group.github.io/)), [Tianjin Huang](https://tianjinyellow.github.io/)@UOE, [Yufei Ding](https://picassolab.squarespace.com/yufei)@UCSD, [Sitao Huang](https://sitaohuang.com/)@UCI and [Kai Zhong](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Kai-Zhong-2196706297)@UESTC.

You can find me through [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=rIdbp9QAAAAJ), [Discord](https://discord.gg/uHQ6brs5) and [Gmail](haotianhu603@gmail.com).
