I'm currently a first-year Machine Learning Ph.D. student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Prof.[Faramarz Fekri](https://fekri.ece.gatech.edu/).

My current research focuses on building efficient and reliable machine learning systems, specifically in the following topics: 
(i) Hypothesis generation with Large Language Models; 
(ii) Large Language Models Towards Reasoning; 
(iii) Deep Learning Theory;

I was fortunate to cooperate with [Tianjin Huang](https://tianjinyellow.github.io/)@UOE, [Yufei Ding](https://picassolab.squarespace.com/yufei)@UCSD, [Zhenyu Zhang](https://zhenyu.gallery/)@UT-Austin (Atlas Wang[VITA](https://vita-group.github.io/)) and [Kai Zhong](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Kai-Zhong-2196706297)@UESTC.

You can find me through [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=rIdbp9QAAAAJ), [Discord](https://discord.gg/uHQ6brs5), [Gmail](haotianhu603@gmail.com) and [Wechat](doueverlovme_)
