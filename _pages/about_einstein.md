I'm currently a first-year Machine Learning Ph.D. student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Georgia Institute of Technology, working with Prof.[Faramarz Fekri](https://fekri.ece.gatech.edu/). Previously, I recieved my bachelor degree from University of Science and Technology of China, School of the Gifted Young. 

My research focuses on hypothesis generation and machine learning systems, specifically in the following topics: 
(i) Hypothesis generation with Large Language Models; 
(ii) Large Language Models Towards Reasoning;
(iii) Deep Learning Theory

I was fortunate to cooperate with [Tianjin Huang](https://tianjinyellow.github.io/)@UOE,[Yufei Ding](https://picassolab.squarespace.com/yufei)@UCSD and [Zhenyu Zhang](https://zhenyu.gallery/)@UT-Austin (Atlas Wang[VITA](https://vita-group.github.io/)).
