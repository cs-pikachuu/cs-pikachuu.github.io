Before getting into how I'm going to manage my life, I want to set an overall Goal for my Ph.D.

Firstly, about time management: 

    Tianlong Chen works 14 hours a day. Since he can do this, I can as well. 
    
I dichotomize my day into two: TA & No TA.

Consider the fact that TA requires 16 hours/week, which I will spend 4 days with 4 hours/day on this.

**TA days: 10 hours research + 4 hours TA**

**Non-TA days: 14 hours reseach**

Now lets see how I can reach 14 hours a day: **wake up at 9:00., sleep at 23:00**.  quite impressive. 

No worries. And one more thing to notice: I'm currently already getting started on my way to success, so start doing it now!!!

My idea:

begin with 12 hours a day at Irvine.

**wake up at 8:00, sleep at 24:00** that would be 16 hours. Consider 1h on the way to school and back, 1hour for lunch, 2h for all the courses I have. I got 12 hours left.

Lets goooo!

1. Set a plan at the beginning of the day.
2. Coffee in the morning
3. Hang out on weekends 6 hours of free time I guess.
4. I don't think I'm going to get a girlfriend as far as I'm concerned, 

One more thing: I think, therefore I am.

Let my journey begin
